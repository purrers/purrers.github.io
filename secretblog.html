                        <br>
                        <p>Let me start the review by saying that Three Phase Studios is where we normally rehearse and the fact that they have a proper bar/cafe on site is probably one of the reasons we rehearse there. Saves us having to go up the road for a drink or snack.</p>
                        <p>Flavour: decent chai, I'll give it 4/5</p>
                        <p>Price: $5.60 for a mug or $4.60 for a cup. It's competitive I suppose 3/5</p>
                        <p>Experience: Depends who's making it. The barista will usually be either J or T (don't wanna mention any names!!) J is maybe a little ham-fisted with the steaming wand and introduces too much foam, so it ends up being about half a mug of foam. T's are good though and everyone who works there is so lovely I'll just say 4/5</p>
                        <p>Next review: Dunno, hardly anywhere has a vegan chai blend :(</p>

                            A few familiar faces from RMIT's Sound Production course -> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thomasinband">Thomasin</a> <- dreamy folk 3-piece, soft-rock with hard strumming? Eli (bass) had even attended a class without being a student..<br>
                            With just one drive pedal, some parts of the set sounded very shoegazey using an acoustic guitar into a fender DRRI. <br>
                            The sound person was not sharing any enthusiasm to use 3x guitar amps but did share their liking for Cameron's aluminium Pearl snare. <br>
                            We played two new instrumentals and Kris beat Mel in an exponentially exciting game of chess after the show.<br>

                        <p>We had our gig at Bar Open a few days ago. Here are some things that happened: <br>
                            -The person who filmed us at Old Bar and uploaded the footage to Youtube was there again, filming and uploading! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0GUe5l5EcE">♫⋆</a><br>
                            -I made a joke about how Bar Open was one of the first places I went to when I turned 18..two years ago. I thought this was pretty funny but nobody else did :( (except Kris) <br>
                            -There's a big old mirror mounted on the roof above the stage and it was fun watching the tops of the other bands' heads while they were playing. <br>
                        Speaking of the other bands, thank you so much to Oceans for having us and Kudos to Ally Mac for having such a lovely country-esque sound! <br>
                        Our next show is at the Bergy front bar on the 29th Feb. (wow it's a leap year)</p>

                        <p>14/01/2024</p>
                        <p>Yesterday we played @ The Old Bar with three cool bands. <br>
                            Town Ace <a href="https://townace.bandcamp.com/">♫⋆</a> on first and minus a guitarist. Admittedly having never heard them before, by the end of the show you questioned the need for lead. <br>
                            Their chords and guitar sounds came across as intricate but also casual, like Trevor Wong(?) but in a cool band, more for the discerning - slacker - everyman.<br>
                            Noticeably, everyone could really play. Silver Jews cover. Came away with a cassette and maybe a slight itch to hear some of these live leeeeads in future i guess. ;| <br>
                            Kiss Heaps <a href="https://kissheaps.bandcamp.com/track/in-a-house-in-coburg">♫⋆</a> were a duo that drew you in with non-threatening fluffy natural fibers. <br>
                            An eerie vulnerable world building singer songwriter, paired with a long-haired emotional craftsman, both creating a set full of melancholic atmospheres. <br>
                            The guitarist wwould slowly twist up, physically effected, delivering tunes between id and ego; while the craftsman hunkered down amongst their mess of instruments on stage, keeping busy. <br>
                            The kind of set you stumble across on youtube around midnight and hunker down with. Wondering how they looped?/sampled? this static, crackly, hum-y accompanyment at times, we later learned it was simply a bad guitar cable. Perfect.<br>
                            Purrers, D, being told to turn down 4 times by the 3rd song. Made worse by the fact the set made it to youtube (if your in this deep: please forgive and forget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THeyOos5cNQ">♫⋆</a>).<br>
                             Vowes to connect to rehearsal/bedroom energy - colour code - live sound communication - etc. <br>
                            Cold Regards -<a href="https://www.facebook.com/toomuchreverb22/">FB</a>- were a match up that worked. Constantly tasteful guitar licks/hooks even - dw, the cool kind of guitar licks. Casio rhythms and reverb heavy keys. But I really enjoyed when things got dark and droney. <br>
                            The Casio keyboard transformed and thoughts of any potential twee 80's indie paisley jangle were gone. Had you left thinking about JAMC and that the PA could turn up.<br>

                        <br>
                            <p>I bought this sticky chai from the supermarket (woolworth's). The stickiness comes from coconut nectar, making it vegan. I appreciate that. I liked the aroma and the flavour was pretty much spot on. Bit expensive though. </p>
                            <p>Flavour: spicy and fruity. I'll give it a 4/5 </p>
                            <p>Price: It's a small packet (100g or 8 serves) and it cost 9 dollars. That's more than a dollar per serve! At the rate I drink chai it won't last me a week. 2/5</p>
                            <p>Experience: Well, I didn't have to talk to anyone to get this chai and I do enjoy the process of brewing it myself. 4/5

                            <p>Our show at Gummo was last night and we all had so much fun. We even got some very nice feedback from some of the punters who weren't our friends! (but they are now) One person said "you're the best shoegaze band in Melbourne." Nice! </p>
                            <p>Some funny things that happened:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>-The door handle for the green room door was missing so if we wanted to open it we had to stick a spoon in the hole where there should have been a handle and twist the spoon around a little bit</li>
                                    <li>-I just straight up forgot how to play some of the songs. Oops!</li>
                                    <li>-We got burgers from Kustom Burgers and while they were delicious they were kinda sloppy so more of the filling fell out than stayed in. </li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>Thank you so much Cafe Gummo for having us. Our next gig is Jan 19th next year with Oceans at BAR OPEN DEFINITELY BAR OPEN THE ONE ON BRUNSWICK ST (I've definitely been telling people it's at Old Bar; I'm always getting the two of them confused!) </p>

                        <p>We played our very first show 4 days ago! If you missed this historic event here are some funny things that happened:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Mope Burn played her DJ set <i>before </i>all the bands. (Everyone thought this was weird except her)</li>
                                <li>Kris put some foam thingies called "Booty Shakers" over the feet of his floor tom, I guess to stop it from moving around??</li>
                                <li>The engineer turned Dave's guitar amp volume down and then Dave just went and turned it right back up. This happened so many times it ended up being like an epic duel between Dave and the engineer. Who won? I dunno.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>Seriously though thanks so much to Brunswick Artists' Bar for having us and Morphemme for playing with us. They are a hard act to follow!!</p>
                        <p>Our next show is at Cafe Gummo in Thornbury on the 17th November this year</p>
